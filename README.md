# Hi, I’m Kate 👋

Cloud Engineer with a strong background in **AWS serverless architectures, data pipelines, and infrastructure as code**. I work primarily with **AWS CDK** to design reproducible, scalable systems, and I’m currently exploring how **LLMs can be integrated into cloud platforms** in a practical, engineering-focused way.

I’m not a machine learning researcher — my focus is on **building reliable platforms that *use* AI**, rather than training large models from scratch. This includes patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), task-specific model refinement, and orchestration of LLM workflows using managed AWS services.

## 🔧 Core Skills

* **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS CDK, Lambda, ECS/Fargate, EC2, VPC, IAM
* **Data Engineering**: AWS Glue, Step Functions, S3, event-driven pipelines
* **AI / LLM Systems (Applied)**: Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker (fine-tuning basics), RAG patterns
* **Dev Practices**: CI/CD, reproducible deployments, cost-aware design

---

## 🧪 Current Focus

* Designing **LLM-enabled serverless architectures** on AWS
* Exploring **Bedrock + retrieval** patterns for real-world workloads
* Building small, well-documented CDK projects that demonstrate *how things fit together*

---

## 📌 Featured Projects

Below are selected repositories that reflect how I think about cloud engineering and applied AI:

* **AWS CDK infrastructure examples** – VPCs, ECS, IAM, and data pipelines
* **Generative AI demos** – focused on integration, not hype
* **End-to-end pipelines** – from ingestion to processing to deployment

Each repository is intentionally scoped and documented to explain *why* a design choice was made.
